  <h1>Thoughts On Progressive Enhancement</h1>
  <p>Content is the essential core of any website and it is required for the website to exist. When we talk about progressive enhancement we are thinking from the core outward.I think the peanut m&m analogy sums it up perfectly. The peanut is the html. It’s all marked up and ready to go with all the important information. The chocolate layer is where you start to make that html pop and give it some style. This is where the reader’s eye is starting to move around a little easier. Finally you have that wonderful hard candy shell. This is where the user can really start to interact and the website becomes a living, breathing thing. It becomes more than just reading content, it becomes an experience. 
  </p><p>With that being said, strong, semantic HTML is crucial for making sure a website works for everyone. Even if a browser glitches out, the internet is crawling, or styles and scripts don’t load, the core content still needs to be accessible. For people with disabilities, it’s even more important—screen readers rely on well-structured HTML to navigate a page, and assistive technologies need proper headings, lists, and landmarks to make sense of everything. It’s not just about keeping things neat; it’s about making sure everyone, no matter their situation, can use and interact with the site. Without that solid foundation, a website can quickly go from functional to frustrating.

  <h1>Web Project Feedback</h1>
  <p>Crystal reviewed my microsite and said it looked good overall, with all the page links working properly. She suggested adding more visuals and improving the overall styling. Since then, I’ve incorporated a slideshow to showcase various campsites around the Cossatot River area, enhancing the site's visual appeal.</p>
