          <h2>Welcome to Cossatot River State Park</h2>
          <p>This park-natural area extends for 12 miles along the National Wild and Scenic Cossatot River. The river forms Cossatot Falls, a rocky canyon with Class IV rapids for experienced kayakers and canoeists when local rainfall increases the watershed. Brushy Creek Recreation Area offers picnic sites, restrooms, and river access. Tent sites (no hookups) are located at the Cossatot Falls Area (six sites), Sandbar Area (15 sites), and Ed Banks Area (two sites). A primitive (no water or electricity) group camping area with tent sites, pavilion, restroom, fire pit, grill, and river access is available by reservation at River Ridge Group Camp. Hikers can enjoy four scenic trails spanning nearly 20 miles. The visitor center features exhibits, a wildlife observation room, meeting room, and gift shop. Interpretive programs are offered year-round.</p>
          <p>The stream heads up in rugged Ouachita mountain country, just southeast of Mena. It flows in a southerly direction for about 26 miles before its current ceases at Gillham Lake. Along the way, the Cossatot travels through the Ouachita National Forest, alongside a wilderness area, and over and around upended layers of jagged bedrock. This last characteristic is what gives the stream its Class IV/Class V rating among river-runners. The Cossatot, however, is not just for floaters. In fact, much of its whitewater is not recommended for casual canoeists. The stream offers something for nearly everyone interested in Arkansas's outdoors.

          </p>
          <p>The name “Cossatot” is an alteration of the French “cassé-tête,” which means “crushed/broken head/skull.” (Compare it to the common phrase “tête-a-tête,” literally meaning “head-to-head,” but in English use, meaning a face-to-face meeting.) The name is possibly a reference to the severity of the rapids in the upper part of the river.</p>
